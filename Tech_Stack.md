# Curious about our tech stack?

👩‍💻 **Infrastructure as Code**

Due to the nature of our business, along with our quick growth, new environments are deployed on a weekly basis (e.g. a new hub opening in Amsterdam, a new Fulfilment Centre in Rotterdam or a new office in Germany). Infrastructure as code enables us to apply Software Engineering methodologies to infrastructure processes and deployments. We use modular code to keep our environments consistent and up to date. But it also allows us to version control and peer review our cloud infrastructure. This means that all teams learn from one another while overseeing each other's work.

📈 **Data-driven**

At Picnic, we’re all about data! Whether it’s to measure the impact of a new feature on the app, to figure out why bananas are the highest selling item (yes, that’s true), or to determine where our next ski trip should take place, we use data to drive every aspect of the business.

🆓 **Open source**

We strongly believe in open sourcing our tech. But don’t take our word for it. Just check out our [Github page](http://picnic.tech/).
